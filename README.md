Tic-Tac-Toe Java Implementation – Summary
This Java program implements a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game between a player and a computer using a 2D array to represent the board. The program features user input validation, a randomized AI opponent, and checks for win/draw conditions. The game continues until a player wins or the board is full.

Key Features:
Game Loop (while loop) – Continuously runs the game until a win or draw occurs.
2D Array (char[][] board) – Represents the game board.
Methods for Modular Code:
printBoard() – Displays the game board.
playerTurn() – Handles user input with validation.
computerTurn() – AI selects a random valid move.
isGameFinished() – Checks for win or draw conditions.
hasContestantWon() – Determines if a player has won.
isValidMove() – Ensures valid move selection.
placeMove() – Updates the board based on input.
Randomization (java.util.Random) – AI selects a random available spot.
User Input Handling (java.util.Scanner) – Reads and validates player moves.

This project demonstrates loops, conditionals, arrays, functions, and object-oriented principles in Java.
